        There is a watershed moment approaching for personalization design.
        Most strategy is still driven out of marketing and IT departments, a holdover from the legacy of the inbound, “creepy” targeted ad.
        According to Colin Eagan, fixing that model requires the same paradigm shift we’ve used to tackle other challenges in our field.
        In this piece, he takes a detailed look at the UX practitioner’s emerging role in personalization design: from influencing technology selection, to data modeling, to page-level implementation.
        It’s now 2019, and the timing couldn’t be better.

        When we think about it, our whole industry depends on our faith in a handful of “black boxes” few of us fully understand: browsers.
        We hand over our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cross our fingers, and hope they render the experience we have in our heads.
        But knowing how they work can really get you out of a jam when things go wrong.
        That’s why we’ve assembled a handful of incredibly knowledgeable authors to take us under the hood in this four-part series.
        Join us on this trip across the web, into the often foggy valley between code and experience.
